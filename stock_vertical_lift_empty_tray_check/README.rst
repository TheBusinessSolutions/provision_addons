When a tray is released, and the system thinks it is empty,
it prompts the user to actually check that it is empty or not.
In any case, an inventory adjustment is done stating the
situation: posted to zero if the tray is actually empty, and
set to draft is it is not empty.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
